# tf.data-based-implementations
a tf.data-based implementation of a generic classifier is implemented, along with an implementation of its DataGenerator-based counter part.
also, the tf.data-based second implementation is once implemented with a transferd learning from pretrained VGG 16 (for Convolutional parts)
